This is Javascript School - a set of lessons covering the Javascript programming language.

We use [jeckyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to generate the site. In order to build it, you must first install it:

	$ gem install jekyll

Now, build the site with 'make'. This will create a copy of the lessons in the 'web.out' folder. For development, 'make serve' will launch 'jekyll' in serving mode: a web server will be launched on port 4000, and changing files will automatically rebuild the site.
