<h2 id="corssfilter">CrossFilter.js</h2>
<p>Crossfilter is a library created by the guys at Square.  If you are still thinking about Backbone Collections, crossfilter is like a collection created to handle thousands of models at once. There is a lot of magic going on behind the scenes, and it is a little more strict about how you need to use it, but it allows for javascript to handle data that it would not usually be able to handle.</p>
<p>Try out crossfilter in a console somewhere, either with node, or in the browser in your developer tools.</p>

<h2 id="map">Map / Reduce</h2>
<p>Map / Reduce is a blanket term for handling flat lists of data. <br />
<span class="caps">TODO</span>: was the term map/reduce originated at Google? Verify.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a map function pulls all relavent data elements, and the reduce function boils those elements down, combining them or minipulating them in whatever way needed. You can have multiple map functions, that continue to filter out elements, and you can have multiple reduce functions that continue to reduce the data down to pure information. It is designed to be flexible enough to be spread across multiple servers (outside of the scope of client side applications), and therefore, in theory, work well web workers. It also makes it easy to reuse map or reduce functions.</p>
